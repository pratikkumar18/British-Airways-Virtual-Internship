# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship
This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.

The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks
Web scraping to gain company insights
Predicting customer buying behaviour
Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights
Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from Skytrax.

Following insights were uncovered as they are summed up in the one slide presentation.

Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This task involves building a high quality predictive to predict the successful bookings using customer bookings data.
